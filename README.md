## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run the Spotify Clone project locally, follow these instructions to set up your own local server, as some features may not work when accessed directly from the file system.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-clone.git
   cd spotify-clone
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   In the project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a Simple Server**:
   Create a new file named `server.js` in the root of your project and add the following code:
   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');
   const fs = require('fs');
   const path = require('path');

   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       let filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'index.html');

       // Check the file extension and set the content type
       const extname = String(path.extname(filePath)).toLowerCase();
       const mimeTypes = {
           '.html': 'text/html',
           '.js': 'text/javascript',
           '.css': 'text/css',
           '.json': 'application/json',
           '.png': 'image/png',
           '.jpg': 'image/jpg',
           '.gif': 'image/gif',
           '.svg': 'image/svg+xml',
           '.wav': 'audio/wav',
           '.mp4': 'video/mp4',
           '.woff': 'application/font-woff',
           '.ttf': 'application/font-sfnt',
           '.eot': 'application/vnd.ms-fontobject',
           '.otf': 'application/font-sfnt',
       };

       const contentType = mimeTypes[extname] || 'application/octet-stream';

       fs.readFile(filePath, (error, content) => {
           if (error) {
               if (error.code == 'ENOENT') {
                   res.writeHead(404);
                   res.end('404 Not Found');
               } else {
                   res.writeHead(500);
                   res.end(`Sorry, there was an error: ${error.code} ..\n`);
               }
           } else {
               res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': contentType });
               res.end(content, 'utf-8');
           }
       });
   });

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   server.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
   });
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   Start your server with:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
